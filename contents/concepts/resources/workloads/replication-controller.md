# Kubernetes ReplicationController

As was said in the Pods section, Pods are **ephemeral** resources that they haven't any **self-healing** mechanism. One of our expectations is the high availability of the Pods. Furthermore, in many scenarios, we want to deploy several instances of our applications. The ReplicationController resource is one of the well-known Kubernetes resources that is used to achieve those things. With ReplicationController, we can achieve **self-healing**, **scaling**, and **desired state** for our applications.

The ReplicationController is watching for any changes in the selected Pods, and it's responsible for making them available based on the desired state that is considered by the user. Three important things should be described in its manifest, the **replicas**, **selector**, and **template**. All Pods that are selected by the ReplicationController are controlled directly with that, and they work as a child of their ReplicationController object. Let's look at the following diagram and describe it:

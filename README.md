# What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes - aka **K8s** - is a container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. With Kubernetes, a set of container engines - Docker, Containerd, CRI-O, etc. - that are deployed on various servers - both physical and virtual - can be brought together to manage complex software-based environments. The set of these servers is called the **Kubernetes Cluster**. So to speak, the Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that can run containers that are managed centrally with an amazing tool called Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a leading container orchestration engine in the current container economy.
